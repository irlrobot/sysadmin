#Intro
This is a collection of howto's, tips, tricks, and tools for troubleshooting Linux issues.  Some of it is from personal experience, but most of it is found from other blogs, forums, and the like.  Credit and citations are given at the bottom of each section where information may have come from.  If I didn't thank you personally when I found your tip/trick/tool then I'll say it here.  Thanks!

#CPU
````nrpoc```` <br>
See number of processors

````lscpu```` <br>
See more CPU info

````cat /proc/cpuinfo```` <br>
See even more CPU info

````sar -u 1```` <br>
Check CPU usage every second

````top```` <br>
See what's happening

##Load Average
````uptime```` <br>
The 3 sets of numbers represent one, five and fifteen minute averages (in that order).

Check number of processors first.  Under N means you're under capacity, at N you're at capacity, over N you've got backup occurring.  Pay most attention to 5 and 15 minute averages.  If you're like 3xN load average for 15 minutes you have a problem to fix for sure because you're likely seeing really bad slowdown.

#Memory

````free```` <br>
See memory info (can use -m or -g for MB and GB respectively)

````cat /proc/meminfo```` <br>
See even more memory info

````ps -aux```` <br>
RSS column is the RAM consumed by each process.  Higher RSS = using more RAM.

````top```` <br>
Sort by memory

##Swapping
Swapping is not caused by any particular process.  A process that is swapping is simply swapping because there is no free RAM left, whether it is responsible or not for running the system out of memory.  So a swapping process can either be the bloated problem child or the tiniest process on the system that just happened to get swapped.  When you run out of memory you swap, simple as that.

Use ````free -m```` and check the used column on the Swap row

Use ````vmstat 1```` and look at the si and so columns.  si is memory swapped into RAM from disk and so is to disk from RAM (per second for both when using ````vmstat 1````).  This lets you verify you're swapping.

#Networking
````netstat -puntl```` <br>
See all TCP and UDP ports listening

````netstat -at```` <br>
All TCP ports

````netstat -au```` <br>
All UDP ports

````netstat -c```` <br>
Print info continuously

More random netstat wizardry:<br>
````netstat -tan | grep ':443' | awk {'print $6'} | sort | uniq -c````<br>
````sudo netstat -nap | grep -i time_wait | wc -l````<br>
````sudo netstat -nap | grep -i close_wait | wc -l````<br>

````lsof | grep LISTEN```` <br>
Also find things that may be listening...

````tcpdump icmp```` <br>
Who's pinging me?

````tcpdump tcp```` <br>
TCP traffic

````tcpdump port 443```` <br>
Monitor a specific port

````tcpdump portrange 20-25```` <br>
Monitor a range of ports

````tcpdump port 443 -w captureFileName```` <br>
Record the capture to a file

````tcpdump -i eth1 icmp```` <br>
Specify a certain interface

````sudo iftop -P -N -f 'dst port 443 or port 80 or port 81 or port 444 or port 445'````<br>
Top for tcpdump

````watch -d -n 2 "sudo ss -a -t -n state established | grep '80\\|81\\|443\\|444\\|445' | wc -l"````<br>
Watch connections drain on a host when you remove from a load balancer.

#Storage
````find . -mtime +7 | xargs du -ch````<br>
Find all files last modified more than 7 days ago in the current directory and total up the used disk space.

````iostat -mdx 1```` <br>
Show extended disk info in MB/s every second

````dd if=/dev/zero of=test bs=1G count=1```` <br>
Measure performance by writing a 1GB file

````dd if=/dev/zero of=test bs=1G count=1 oflag=dsync```` <br>
Same as above but using dsync skips cache

#Strace
````strace -p PID```` <br>
Where PID is the process ID in question (ps aux | grep name).  What is that process doing right now?

````strace -c -p PID```` <br>
Where PID is the process ID in question (ps aux | grep name).  What is the process spending time on?

````strace -ttT program/script```` <br>
Run a trace on the program/script and output to the screen (redirect to a file is usually desired here).  Prefix line with time including microseconds and show the time spent in system calls.

````sudo strace -e trace=network -p <PID> 2>&1 | grep IPADDR````<br>
This is useful if you need to see if a PID is making connections to something it should or should not be.  For example, used this once to determine HAProxy was still connecting to an old IP after DNS was changed for a server.

#MySQL
create user that can only connect lcoally and give full perms on a DB<br>
````grant ALL PRIVILEGES on databasename.* to user@localhost;````
		
just a table <br>
````grant ALL PRIVILEGES on database.table to user@localhost;````
		
set password <br>
````set password for user = password('thePassowrd');````
		
cleanup <br>
````flush privileges;````
		
create superuser that can connect from anywhere <br>
````grant ALL PRIVILEGES on *.* TO 'user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password' WITH GRANT OPTION;````
