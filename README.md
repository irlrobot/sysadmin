This is a collection of random sysadmin-y things. Part stuff I made, part stuff borrowed.  If there's something borrowed and I didn't give you credit then let me know and I'll be sure to fix that.

Since this repo is just my personal junk collection, I've highlighted a few things that could be interested to the random passeryby here:
<ol>
<li>troubleshooting.md - my Linux troubleshooting guide - https://github.com/irlrobot/sysadmin/blob/master/troubleshooting.md</li>
<li>bashrc and vimrc - my bash and vim config files (make sure to rename them with a leading '.')</li>
<li>deploy.rb - a simple way to run one or more commands on one or more hosts (dead simple bash via ssh using pub key auth) - https://github.com/irlrobot/sysadmin/blob/master/deploy/deploy.rb</li>
</ol>
